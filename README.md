Lily's Library Store

It is a website for complete beginners of web development using almost all basic concepts of html and css. A very litte javascript has been use to validate the login form.

Login page--
It is the landing page having UserId and Password to be filled as given in the placeholder. Just in case you aren't feeling like typing lot, I have put a link in the forgot password that will take you directly to the home page.

Home page--
It starts with a marquee tag (although it is not recommended, using js and css should preffered but I used it as it was an important topic).
Then comes the navigation bar, heading and a table to navigate in the page.
Categories with pictures that show some functionality on hover.
Then obviously the footer

Cart page--
IT has the navigation bar and footer copy pasted from the home page.
A picture in the mid saying cart empty because obviously cart functionalities require server side scripting.

That was all, do let me know if you have any suggestions.
